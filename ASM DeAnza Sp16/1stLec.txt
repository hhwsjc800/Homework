Name: Kamran Eftekhari, Ph.D CompSci Umich->MIT->Carnegie Mellon->NSA->Director of machine learning division at Google

book: Assembly Language on the interwobz

Virtualization: hide reality of memory, give nice physical picture

3eme:
-Living in memory, i.e a process -- what is a structure of a process?
--Converting process into a file that machine can understand
-must understand all these details for compsci
-for all of this, need to know how data is represented in a computer

==Enterprise software usually has all elements of computer science:
.. architecture
.. operating system
.. networking

recommended book: Computer Systems, Pearson

--Without cache, then need to wait for days for each program


===Interview question: which program is cache-friendly?
..how to program/code in order to be cache-friendly?
..will provide lectures based on Computer Systems and Orgainzation 

--Book is based on Intel notation (Bay area notation is ATNT)



============

-must end main with end main
ex:
main someFunc
mov eax, 5
add eax, 5

invoke exitProcess, 0
someFunc Endp
end someFunc
